pacman -Qqm lists foreign packages; which, for must users, means AUR

pacman -Qqe lists packages that were explicitely installed.



$ pacman -Qqe > pkglist.txt
Note: If you used -Qqet, when reinstalling the list all the non-top-level packages would be set as dependencies.
To install packages from the list backup, run:
# pacman -S - < pkglist.txt
